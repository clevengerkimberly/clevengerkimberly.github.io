title: About Me
---

Hello! I'm Kim Clevenger, a post-doc at the National Cancer Institute. I do research on physical activity measurement and how the physical environment affects children's participation in physical activity. I particularly like working with GPS and accelerometer data, making maps, and screaming from the rooftops about the importance of free-play for children.

Before NCI, I completed my:
- MPH in Quantitative Methods at Harvard
- PhD in Kinesiology at Michigan State University
- MS and BS in Exercise Physiology at Ohio University
